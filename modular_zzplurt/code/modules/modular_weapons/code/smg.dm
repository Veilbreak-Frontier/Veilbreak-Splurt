		This particular design suffered from the same issue as the RTA Prototype CMG, \

		with the other parts made of wood. However, the new method was performed by pressing together thin sheets of steel with a stamping machine that would then weld the parts together as it went\
		Even though the small caliber this uses makes this more of a pistol-caliber carbine than any assault rifle, countless arguments in both the marketing office \
		and the corporate boardroom about the name meant that something had to give; in this case, the RnD team was ruled in favour of rather than against.<br>\
		<br>\
		It's hard to cover up everything about its troubled development, though.<br>\
		<br>\
		People that were in charge were demanding tolerances from plastic moulding that could really only be achieved by the precision of being carved from solid steel.  \
		This weapon has a straight blowback system and ejects the round vertically down safetly behind the user, unlike the Prototype CMG which ejected casing directly into the shoulder of the user should they be left handed (Although this was addressed by making the rifle a caseless flechette launcher),\
		The CMG does not exist anymore due to the systematic eradication of the company workers, leaving this the few surviving design from those time.\
		Nanotrasen RND Department have been unable to mass-produce proper intermediate cartridges. With any rifle properly chambered in such caliber only reserved for the Military Branch \
		Despite this, the existence of this weapon was a testament to the creativity of the people working for this company." \
